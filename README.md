These are some sample programs I wrote in my CIS3090 (Object Oriented Programming for Business class) for a project that I was assigned to do. The program descriptions are listed below....

Part 1 is a program that will give the user the season of a given date, utilizing multiple switch statements.

Part 2 is a program that will play a "quick" game of rock, paper, scissors with the user. 

Palindrome is a palindrome testing program that utilizes a while loop to search through the entirety of a given word by the user. i.e if the program is given a word such as "racecar" it would test each position in this given word and check to see if each position is equivalent to its' counter part at the end of the word. If every word matches up the palindrome tester will flag the given word as a "palindrome".
