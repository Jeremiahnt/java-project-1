Part 1 is a program that will give the user the season of a given date, utilizing multiple switch statements.

Palindrome is a palindrome testing program that utilizes a while loop to search through the entirety of a given word by the user. i.e if the program is given a word such as "racecar" it would test each position in this given word and check to see if each position is equivalent to its' counter part at the end of the word. If every word matches up the palindrome tester will flag the given word as a "palindrome".
